    <p>
        As a software engineer with an interest in documentation, I wanted to create a way to explore the different avenues of documenting code available. What better way than creating an API and app to house the different methods and tools available for technical documentation, e.g. Open API and Swagger, Postman, Gitbook, Getting Started docs, blogs, etc.

        One of the greatest things about continuing to learn about documentation is that there are so many resources online that other writers are ecstatic to share. This app was inspired by the repo beautiful docs by @[matheusfelipeog](https://github.com/matheusfelipeog).

        With that in mind, here's a list of docs and other developer resources that myself and others find particularly useful, well-written, and otherwise "beautiful." May they serve to inspire you when writing and designing yours."</p>

        The open collaboration and willingness to share that I have encountered while I have been learning more about documentation has inspired me to “app-ify” this repo and begin to create a community for displaying beautiful documentation.
